Revision history for Log::Log4perl (test1)
##################################################

TODO:

* need level validation on Logger::level() 
* test cases should use platform independend directory separator (Mac's pre-OSX ':'?)
* can we parse multiple appenders for a category? e.g.
        log4j.category.a.b = WARN, console, logfile


Kevin:
* Create new module negotiating between Java-style config files
  and perl-style appenders
* Module for reading XML-style config files
DONE (is gone) redo level_str() hack
DONE (Dispatch singleton) question - are appenders created just once if they're reused in the config file?


Mike:
* Define default if there's no layout:
  http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/org/apache/log4j/SimpleLayout.html
* Tune performance of level() lookups
 (Mike, check out the log4j statement:
 "As a side note, let me mention that in log4j child loggers link only to their 
  existing ancestors. In particular, the logger named com.foo.Bar is linked 
  directly to the root logger, thereby circumventing the unused com or com.foo
  loggers. This significantly increases performance and reduces log4j's memory 
  footprint. "
* %% bug in Layout.pm
* Layout.pm: 'd', 't', 'x', 'X'
* Documentation
* Signal to re-read the conf file.
* Several appenders in one config line:
    log4j.rootLogger=debug, stdout, R
* Additivity flag -- set/get as API and in cfg file
* Simplify interface to go through Log::Log4perl->blah()
  instead Log::Log4perl::Logger->blah() as suggested by Kevin

    * %p should return level name of the calling function, so 
      $logger->warn('bad thing!!') should print 'WARN - bad thing'
      even if the category is set to debug, so took level_str out of
      Logger.pm (kg)

0.09 07/03/2002
    * %p should return level name, not number, adding level_str to Logger.pm (kg)
    * Level.pm - discriminating: priorities are 1-4, levels are 'info','debug',etc (kg)

0.08  07/03/2002
    * Non-root loggers are working now off the config file

0.07  07/02/2002
    * Updated documentation
    * removed "diagnostics"

0.06  07/01/2002
    * Bug discovered by Kevin Goess <cpan@goess.org>, revealed
      in 004-Config.t: Wrong layout used if Appender is inherited.
      Fixed.
    * Changed Log::Dispatch::Buffer to keep track of the
      object population -- so we can easily reference them
      in the Log::Log4perl test cases. Got rid of get_buffer().
    * Added a reset() method to Log::Log4perl and Log::Log4perl::Logger
      for easier testing. It resets all persistent loggers to 
      the inital state.
    * Added documentation

0.05  06/30/2002
    * Fixed bug with mapped priorities between java/Log::Dispatch
    * Java/Perl integration with conf file

0.04  06/30/2002
    * Layout tests
    * %r to layout
    * Added lib4j configuration file stuff and tests

0.03  06/30/2002
    * Layout
    * Curly braces in Layout first ops

0.02  06/30/2002
    * Created Logger and test cases

0.01  06/22/2002
    * Where it all began
