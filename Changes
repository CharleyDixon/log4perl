Revision history for Log::Log4perl
##################################################

TODO:

* question - are appenders created just once if they're reused in the config file?
* need level validation on Logger::level() and level_str()
* redo level_str() hack

Kevin:
* Create new module negotiating between Java-style config files
  and perl-style appenders
* Module for reading XML-style config files
* Level.pm - discriminating: priorities are 1-4, levels are 'info','debug',etc


Mike:
* Define default if there's no layout:
  http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/org/apache/log4j/SimpleLayout.html
* Tune performance of level() lookups
* %% bug in Layout.pm
* Layout.pm: 'd', 't', 'x', 'X'
* Documentation
* Signal to re-read the conf file.
* Several appenders in one config line:
    log4j.rootLogger=debug, stdout, R
* Additivity flag -- set/get as API and in cfg file
* Simplify interface to go through Log::Log4perl->blah()
  instead Log::Log4perl::Logger->blah() as suggested by Kevin

    * Non-root loggers are working now off the config file

0.07  07/02/2002
    * Updated documentation

0.06  07/01/2002
    * Bug discovered by Kevin Goess <cpan@goess.org>, revealed
      in 004-Config.t: Wrong layout used if Appender is inherited.
      Fixed.
    * Changed Log::Dispatch::Buffer to keep track of the
      object population -- so we can easily reference them
      in the Log::Log4perl test cases. Got rid of get_buffer().
    * Added a reset() method to Log::Log4perl and Log::Log4perl::Logger
      for easier testing. It resets all persistent loggers to 
      the inital state.
